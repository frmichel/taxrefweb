# TAXREF-Web SPARQL micro-services

This project provides [SPARQL micro-services](https://github.com/frmichel/sparql-micro-service) developped for the needs of the [National Museum of Natural History of Paris](https://www.mnhn.fr/) to access multiple biodiversity-related Web APIs using a uniform language, SPARQL, and a uniform representation based on well-adopted vocabularies.
