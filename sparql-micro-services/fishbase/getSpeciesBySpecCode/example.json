      "Comments": "Inhabit streams and rivers in foothills with well oxygenated, fast-flowing water.  All age classes occur in open water of streams and small rivers (Ref. 59043).  Found also in rivers with very calm waters.  Feed on insect larvae and dead insects (Ref. 9696), as well as on crustaceans and diatoms.  Spawn in small groups and lay eggs deep into gravel with swift current.  Locally threatened by stream regulation, trout stocking and pollution.  Attain a maximum size of up to about 13 cm SL (Ref. 59043).",
